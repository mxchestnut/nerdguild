Typography is the foundation of interface design. Before users interact with buttons or navigate menus, they read text. Good typography makes information accessible, scannable, and pleasant to consume.

Hierarchy matters more than decoration. A well-defined type scale creates visual rhythm and guides the eye through content. Size, weight, and spacing work together to establish relationships between elements.

In complex applications, typography becomes infrastructure. Consistent type styles reduce cognitive load and help users build mental models of your interface. They learn to recognize headings, labels, and body text at a glance.

Don't overlook line length and spacing. Readable text isn't just about font choice—it's about how text flows and breathes on the page. Aim for 60-75 characters per line for optimal readability.

Typography is invisible when done right. Users shouldn't notice your font choices—they should simply find information effortlessly.
