Every feature has a cost. It adds complexity to your codebase, creates maintenance burden, and increases the surface area for bugs. More importantly, it adds cognitive load for users who must learn and understand it.

The best products aren't feature-complete—they're focused. They do a few things exceptionally well rather than many things adequately. This focus creates clarity for both users and the team building the product.

Saying no is a superpower. Every feature request is an opportunity to validate whether it serves your core value proposition. Most don't. Declining features keeps your product sharp and your team focused on what matters.

Minimalism isn't about removing useful functionality—it's about eliminating everything that doesn't serve the user's primary goal. Strip away the cruft and what remains is a product that users actually understand and enjoy using.

Simple products scale better, both technically and conceptually. Complexity is easy. Simplicity takes discipline.
